# FUPD

Me and a few friends started FUPD in early 2016 as a joke. it stands for Faze Uplay Division, 
We used to play R6 pretty seriously and just thought it was funny. We still maintain 
An active <a href="https://discord.gg/XBTzf4S">Discord</a> and a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/FazeUplay">Steam Group</a>.
Feel free to join us we play a huge variety of games!
